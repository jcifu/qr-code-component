## My process

This project was developed with HTML5 and CSS basics.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This exercise was helpful to understand the concepts, use and correct application of flexbox on a nested containers (divs). I also started to learn how to configure the padding for each container to aim at a pixel perfect design. 

### Continued development

I still have to improve the responsive design, perhaps that is the principal problem of the this solution. And my CSS coding, obviously.

### Useful resources
